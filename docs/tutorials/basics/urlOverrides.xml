<h2>Debugging with URL Overrides</h2>
<p>This tutorial uses the sample code from the <a 
href="?article=basics/introduction">introduction</a> tutorial. 
Remember how we set the <span class="code">$objAppDoc->blnDebug = true;</span>, 
well it allows us to use what we
call <strong>&quot;URL overrides&quot;</strong> - special URL parameters. See 
the web address used in the LIVE-OUTPUT block below. This feature is very
very useful during the course of development.</p>
<tutor:highlightFile src="introduction/index.php?xao:XML" type="LIVE-OUTPUT" />
<h3>Debug XML Source</h3>
<p>Note that you can preview the XML source content before it is transformed
by passing it the following URL pareter name (doesn't need a value).</p>
<p><span class="code">xao:XML</span></p>
<p>For this to work, we had to set <span class="code">$objAppDoc->blnDebug = true;</span></p>
<p>Your browser may transform it for you - in which case you will have to 
<em>view-source</em>. IE ignores the &quot;ContentType: text/plain;&quot; header
which is sent when using the xao:XML override.

<tutor:highlightFile src="introduction/index.php?xao:XSL" type="LIVE-OUTPUT" />
<h3>Debug XSL Stylesheet</h3>
<p>Same can be done to preview the XSL being used. This is useful when the
stylesheet is manipulated programatically before use or the stylesheet is
dynamically generated. Use the following URL override:</p>
<p><span class="code">xao:XSL</span></p>
<br clear="all" />
<h3>Security issues</h3>
<p>Note that URL overrides are not available until debuging is switched on.</p>
