          <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
          <p>WELCOME TO <strong>XML APPLICATION OBJECTS</strong> version <strong>1.0alpha</strong>. XAO is a suite of <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a> classes which [web] application developers can use to speed up application development. XAO is also a scalable framework designed to be <em>extended</em> by the developer. XAO is <strong>implemented using standards</strong> based technology as specified by the <a href="http://www.w3c.org" target="_blank">W3C</a>. It utilises <a href="http://github.com/tezza1971/XAO-PHP/ctrl.php?op=links-xml" target="_blank">XML</a> based technologies, namely the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> API and <a href="http://github.com/tezza1971/XAO-PHP/ctrl.php?op=links-xslt" target="_blank">XSL</a>-Transformations (XSLT).</p>

          <h3>About this release (1.0a)</h3>
      
          <p>XAO is (and always will be) a work in progress. There are actually many other classes under development which are not included in this distribution. <em>We have big plans for the future</em>. In the mean time, what you have here is the core set of functionality. Which, as it happens, is enough to build scalable, well-designed, object oriented, standards compliant web applications.</p>
      
          <p>This is an Alpha release, so please report any bugs or strange behavior to our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=302977">discussion forum</a> or the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=88235">mailing list</a>. In fact, we would be grateful for any feedback at all, so by all means, stop by the forum for a chat or register on the mailing list.</p>

          <h3>Install notes</h3>
          
          <p>After meeting the system requirements as mentioned below, it will pay to copy the <strong><em>contents</em></strong> of the &quot;classes&quot; directory of this distribution into your PHP includes directory. For more information on where your PHP include directory is, see the <strong>include_path</strong> directive in your PHP.ini file. You may like to simply add an additional path which points to the classes directory of this distribution.</p>
      
          <p>The alternative to locating the classes in the include directory is to provide comprehensive path information every time you include one of the library files (not good). You'll note how awkward this is when you see the source-code in the tutorials. The tutorials were done this way so they would work out-of-the-box.</p>
